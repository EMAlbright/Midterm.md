Q6.) foo(10.0, 20.5) = 30.5
     foo(3, 4) = 13
     foo(8, 3.0) = An error since one method takes two integers and the other method takes two doubles. However,
     there is no argument for an integer and then a double.

Q7.) These 2 methods are overloaded. This is because when a method is overriding another method, they have the same 
     method signature. In the two methods above, the top method 'foo' takes in 2 integers while the bottom method 'foo'
     takes in 2 doubles.
